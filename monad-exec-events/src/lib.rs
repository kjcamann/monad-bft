//! Idiomatic and safe types for interacting with `monad` execution event rings.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! Add `monad-event-ring` and `monad-exec-events` as dependencies to your Cargo.toml and enable
//! the `"event-ring"` feature for `monad-exec-events`.
//!
//! ```custom
//! cargo add --git https://github.com/monad-crypto/monad-bft monad-event-ring
//! cargo add --git https://github.com/monad-crypto/monad-bft monad-exec-events --features event-ring
//! ```
//!
//! Next, create an event ring and start consuming events!
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use monad_event_ring::{
//! #     DecodedEventRing, EventDescriptor, EventNextResult, EventPayloadResult, EventRingPath,
//! # };
//! # use monad_exec_events::{ExecEventRing};
//! #
//! # let unresolved_event_ring_path: &'static str = unimplemented!();
//! #
//! let event_ring_path = EventRingPath::resolve(unresolved_event_ring_path).unwrap();
//!
//! let event_ring = ExecEventRing::new(event_ring_path).unwrap();
//!
//! let mut event_reader = event_ring.create_reader();
//!
//! loop {
//!     let event_descriptor = match event_reader.next_descriptor() {
//!         EventNextResult::Gap => {
//!             // Handle EventRing gap!
//!             unimplemented!();
//!         }
//!         EventNextResult::NotReady => {
//!             // This will busy-wait until an event is ready.
//!             continue;
//!         }
//!         EventNextResult::Ready(event_descriptor) => event_descriptor,
//!     };
//!
//!     match event_descriptor.try_read() {
//!         EventPayloadResult::Expired => {
//!             // Handle EventRing payload expiry (similar to gap)!
//!             unimplemented!();
//!         }
//!         EventPayloadResult::Ready(exec_event) => {
//!             // Do something with the event!
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! For more details about EventRing operation in general, see the
//! [`monad_event_ring`](../monad_event_ring/index.html) library documentation.
//!
//! # Block-Oriented Updates
//!
//! Event sources using an [`ExecEventDecoder`] can produce individual `monad` execution events.
//! While some applications may benefit from operating on individual events or by observing them as
//! quickly as possible, many would prefer to process entire blocks. This library provides the
//! [`ExecutedBlockBuilder`] utility to reconstruct blocks from an event source, providing
//! block-oriented updates that can be converted to alloy blocks using the alloy feature flag.
//! See [`ExecutedBlockBuilder`] for more details.
//!
//! This utility however produces all blocks that are executed, which could be in any
//! [`BlockCommitState`]. For applications interested in consuming blocks once they have reached a
//! certain commit state, usually [`BlockCommitState::Voted`], applications can use the
//! [`CommitStateBlockBuilder`] which produces a block along with its current commit state every time
//! the block's commit state changes. See [`CommitStateBlockBuilder`] for more details.
